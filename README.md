# Git-trial
A small test on how to git

To succeed in this trial all the commits have to be done from gitlab user

Here's the task itself:
  1. Create a branch from master with name: {Your name}_master
  1. Make a commit with single .txt file containing: 'Hello'
  1. In seperate branch create same .txt file containing 'Hello1'
  1. Same a previous step, but file should contain 'Hello2'
  1. Merge these 2 brances into {Your name}_master
  1. Solve merge conflicts
  1. Create pull request into master
  
All of these steps should be done localy and commited seperatly

Git commands used to solve this task should be sent to Maxraw via Discord
